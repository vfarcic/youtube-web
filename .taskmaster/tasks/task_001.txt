# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Mock API Endpoints for Video Editing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement mock data and functions in JavaScript to simulate the backend API endpoints for video editing aspects, then design and implement the video editing interface in the mock environment.
# Details:
The task consists of two main phases:

Phase 1: Mock API Implementation (Completed)
1. Create a comprehensive mock data structure in mockup.js that includes:
   - Sample video list with multiple entries
   - Phase statistics for dashboard display
   - Complete video details for each sample video
   - Data for all 6 editing aspects per video:
     * initial-details
     * work-progress
     * definition
     * post-production
     * publishing
     * post-publish

2. Implement JavaScript functions that simulate API responses:
   - getVideoList() - Returns list with optional phase filtering
   - getVideoDetails(videoName) - Returns complete details for a specific video
   - getPhaseStatistics() - Returns aggregated phase data
   - getAspectData(videoName, aspect) - Returns data for a specific aspect of a video

3. Ensure all mock data follows the field mappings from the PRD to match the expected API response structure.

4. Include simulated delay and error conditions to facilitate testing of loading states and error handling.

Phase 2: Video Editing Interface Design (Current Focus)
1. Analyze the current mock interface structure to understand how to integrate the editing components
2. Identify and list all required editing UI elements based on the PRD requirements
3. Design the aspect-based editing interface for all 6 editing aspects:
   - initial-details
   - work-progress
   - definition
   - post-production
   - publishing
   - post-publish
4. Add the editing views/modals to the mock HTML structure
5. Implement interactive elements in the mockup to demonstrate user flows
6. Ensure the mock interface aligns with the PRD specifications before implementing in the real application

# Test Strategy:
Phase 1 Testing (Completed):
Verify that all mock functions return appropriate data structures. Test with various parameters to ensure proper filtering and data access. Validate that the structure matches the expected API schema.

Phase 2 Testing (Current Focus):
1. Review the mock interface against PRD requirements to ensure all editing components are represented
2. Test the navigation flow between different editing aspects
3. Verify that the interface correctly displays mock data from the API functions
4. Test interactive elements to ensure they demonstrate the intended user experience
5. Validate the visual design against any provided mockups or wireframes
6. Use browser console and application testing to verify the mock interface components work as expected
